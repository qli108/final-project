# Drawing on the Web - Final Project

<em> by Kelly Li</em>

<p>For my final project, I want to create a 3d ambiance inspired by my favorite films. The films I plan to imitate on the web are: The Great Beauty, In the Mood for Love and Columbus. These films are a bit slow and linger in its cinematography. Shots are held a little longer than usual which I find captivating. In an age where we're constantly surrounded by information and content, I want to juxtapose this new reality through my drawings.

<p>One reason why we watch films is to enter another world and escape from reality for an hour or more. The experience I'm hoping to elicit is one of nostalgia and sentimentality that will be similar to the film's aesthetic. To achieve this, I will be using WebGL, three.js library, and JavaScript DOM animation for each drawing. As a final touch, audio will be included to add to the ambiance. The scenes should be almost hypnotic to the viewer similar to when we're watching a good movie and can't look away from the screen. Therefore, interactivity will be limited in the drawings but not on the interface; the interface will act as the remote control. The user will decide which movie (drawing) he/she wants to watch.
